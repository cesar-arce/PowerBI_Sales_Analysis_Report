## Problem Statement

This dashboard is designed to provide insights into the sales performance of our products across various channels. By analyzing by Vendor, Period, Segment, Country and Product. We can identify sales trends, areas of strength and weakness, helping the organization understand which products are performing well and which are underperforming.

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total sales, sales by product category, and sales trends over time. It allows us to identify seasonal patterns and customer preferences, thereby guiding inventory management and marketing strategies.

Currently, the analysis reveals that approximately 60% of total sales come from just three product categories, indicating a potential over-reliance on specific offerings. Additionally, certain regions show significantly lower sales figures compared to others, suggesting that targeted marketing efforts or product availability may need to be re-evaluated.

By leveraging the insights from this dashboard, the organization can make data-driven decisions to enhance product offerings, optimize pricing strategies, and ultimately increase overall sales performance.

Visual 1: Overall Sales Performance
Description: This chart presents the total sales figures over the past year. The x-axis represents the months, while the y-axis shows the sales revenue.

Insight: We can observe a noticeable increase in sales during the holiday season (November and December), indicating strong seasonal demand. However, there is a dip in sales during the summer months, suggesting a need for targeted marketing strategies during that period.

Visual 2: Sales by Product Category
Description: This pie chart displays the distribution of sales across different product categories.

Insight: Approximately 60% of total sales are attributed to three primary categories. This highlights a potential risk if any of these categories face supply chain issues. We should consider diversifying our product range to mitigate this risk.
